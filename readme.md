# MUSIC

The slimiest sounds in the swamp.


## /DST

This is where you'll find `.mp3`s, sheet music, and other media.


## /SRC

This is where I make things. 

If you want to edit/remix a song, do a pull request. 
Send tracks to slimelord@hush.com if you're too stupid to figure out git.

### USAGE

``` bash

# clone recursively to include the extempore submodule
git clone --recursive https://github.com/slimelord/music.git slimelord-music

```
